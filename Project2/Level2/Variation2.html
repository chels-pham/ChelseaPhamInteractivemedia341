    <p>The <h1>rose</h1> is a <h2>rose,</h2>
      And was <em>always</em> a <h3>rose.</h3><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      But the theory now goes <br />
      That the apple’s a <h2>rose,</h2>
      And the pear is, and so’s <br />
      The plum, I suppose. <br />
      The dear only knows<br />
      What will next prove a <h3>rose.</h3><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You, of course, are a <h1>rose</h1> –
      But were <em>always</em> a <h3>rose.</h3>
