      <h1>The Rose Family</h1>
      The rose is a rose,
      And was <em>always</em> a rose.</br>

      But the theory now goes
      <ul>
          <li>That the <strong><em>apple’s</em></strong> a rose,</li>
          <li>And the <strong><em>pear</em></strong> is, and so’s</li>
          <li>The <strong><em>plum</em></strong>, I suppose.</li>
      </ul>
      The dear only knows
          What will next prove a rose.
          You, of course, are a rose –</br>

        But were <em>always</em> a rose.</br>
