      <b>The</b> rose is a rose, and was always a rose.</br>
      But the theory now goes that the <b>apple’s</b> a rose,</br>
      And the pear <b>is,</b> and so’s the plum, I suppose.</br>
      The dear only knows what will next prove <b>a</b> rose.</br>
      You, of course, are a <b>rose</b> – but were always a rose.</br>
