      The rose is a rose,
      and was always a rose.
      But the theory now goes
      that the apple’s a rose,
      and the pear is, and so’s
      the plum, I suppose.
      The dear only knows
      what will next prove a rose.
      You, of course, are a rose –
      but were always a rose.
