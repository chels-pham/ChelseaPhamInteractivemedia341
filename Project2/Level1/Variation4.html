      The rose is a rose,
      And was always a rose.
      But the theory now goes
      That the apple’s a rose,
      And the pear is, and so’s
      The plum, I suppose.
      The dear only knows
      What will next prove a rose.
      You, of course, are a rose –
      But were always a rose.
