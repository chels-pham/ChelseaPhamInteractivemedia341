        The rose is a rose,
        and was always a rose.
        But the theory now goes
        that the apple’s a rose,
        and the pear is, and so’s
        the plum, I suppose.
        The dear only knows
        what will next prove a rose.

        You, of course, are a rose –
        but were always a rose.
